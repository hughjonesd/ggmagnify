## R CMD check results


* Checked on win-devel and mac-release with 2 notes which were fixed.
* A note about "ggplot" and "geom" in the description. I think this is fine.
  'But' 'I' 'will' 'put' 'everything' 'in' 'quotes' 'if' 'it' 'really' 'floats'
  'your' 'boat'.
* This is a new release.
* It messes with ggplot2 in a very dubious way, but doesn't actually access any
  non-exported functions.
